Hey there! I'm Zhonghao, an **ML Engineer** dedicated to using **technology for social good**. I've helped banks and other large companies build **cloud-based AI solutions**, all aimed at benefiting society. I'm also a proud graduate of both the **[Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/)** and **[National University of Singapore](https://nus.edu.sg/)**, for which I'm extremely grateful for the education I received. When I'm not knee-deep in code, you'll find me exploring new places and diving into interesting reads. To me, learning never really stops. Drop me a line, and let's hangout sometime! üéÆ‚òïÔ∏è
